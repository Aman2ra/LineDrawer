# LineDrawer
The line drawer is a project that takes an image given by the user and then draws the outlines in the image onto a whiteboard using various motors. I made this to expand my understanding of Python, Arduino, and how they are used together to make and operate a machine. It is a more complicated project than the ones Iâ€™ve done before as there are more components, both virtual and physical, as well as different versions of the project I had to make in order to test the various code components. It is still not perfect as I had to use cardboard and wooden skewers as the construction material which brought bugs into the physical version and made the project unstable.

Please read the "Line Drawer.pdf" in the repository for a full and very detailed breakdown with pictures and images
Thanks!
